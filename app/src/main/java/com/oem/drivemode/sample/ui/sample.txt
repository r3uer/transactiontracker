## Plan: Transaction Tracker App Implementation

This plan outlines how to add a transaction tracker feature to your existing Android/Kotlin/Jetpack Compose project. It covers UI design, data modeling, local storage with Room, ViewModel/state management, Compose integration, testing, and Gradle/dependency updates. The steps are tailored to your current project structure under `app/src/main/java/com/oem/drivemode/sample/`.

### Steps
1. **Design UI screens**:
   - Add Compose screens for listing transactions, adding a new transaction, and deleting transactions.
   - Place new UI files in `app/src/main/java/com/oem/drivemode/sample/ui/`.

2. **Define Transaction data model**:
   - Create a `Transaction.kt` data class with fields like id, amount, description, date.
   - Place in a new or existing `model` package.

3. **Set up Room database**:
   - Add Room dependencies in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
   - Create `TransactionDao`, `TransactionDatabase`, and necessary entities in a `data` package.

4. **Implement ViewModel and state management**:
   - Create a `TransactionViewModel` in a `viewmodel` package.
   - Use `StateFlow` or `LiveData` for transaction list and UI state.

5. **Integrate ViewModel with Compose UI**:
   - Connect ViewModel to Compose screens for displaying, adding, and deleting transactions.
   - Use state hoisting and event callbacks.

6. **Update Gradle dependencies**:
   - Ensure Room, lifecycle, and Compose dependencies are up to date in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

### Further Considerations
1. Should deleted transactions be soft-deleted (archived) or permanently removed?
2. Do you want to support editing transactions, or just add/delete?
3. Consider using Hilt or another DI framework for easier testing and modularity.
4. Should the transaction list support sorting/filtering (by date, amount, etc.)?
